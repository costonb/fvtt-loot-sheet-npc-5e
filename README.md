# Loot Sheet NPC 5E

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests or merchants in your game. It has a permission system that allows observers to make loot or ourchase actions which will automatically process the item transaction, including inventory moves and currency changes. 

A loot sheet allows players with the right permissions to loot items from it, while a merchant sheet lets them purchase the items in exchange for currency. Merchant sheets can also be populated via rolls from rollable tables. This allows a GM to quickly create varied inventories for their merchants. A couple of rollable tables are included and can be imported via standard rollable table methods. It is also compatible with our rollable table collections such as https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundry_community_tables.

### History

The latest version is based on the dnd5e 3.0 NPC sheet and thus requires at least version 3.0.0 of that system.

This version was forked from Hooking's module which ended compatibility with Foundry VTT version 0.3.9 (https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---loot-sheet-npc). This fork should be updated by me to keep it current with Foundry VTT.

I will only maintain a DND5e compatible version of this mod, but I encourage forks for other systems as well as accept pull requests and contributions for this one. I'm very busy and appreciate all current and future contributors!

##### Permissions
Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) to observer (view sheet and contents and utilize loot or buy buttons) to owner (view sheet and add/remove items and configure sheet).
